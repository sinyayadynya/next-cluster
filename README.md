Introduction
------------

The **Schema.org Blueprints Next.js demo** provides a starting point for 
building a Next.js front-end for a Drupal site created using the 
[Schema.org Blueprints](https://www.drupal.org/project/schemadotorg) module.

This demo/starter is based on the
[simple starter for Next.js and Drupal](https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal-basic-starter)
and incorporates components and utilities from the
[Next.js for Acquia CMS](https://github.com/acquia/next-acms) starter template.

The primary goal of the starter is to provide a POC that Next.js components can 
be dynamically generated for Nodes (node.tsx) and Media (media.tsx) using the 
`drush schemadotorg:next-components-create` command.
